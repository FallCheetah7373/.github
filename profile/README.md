<h1 align="center">Freedium - Your paywall breakthrough for Medium!</h1>

## FAQ
### Why do we create Freedium?
In mid-June to mid-July 2023, Medium changed paywall method, and all old paywall bypass methods we had stopped working. So I became obsessed with the idea of creating a service to bypass Medium's paywalled posts. Honestly I am not a big fan of Medium, but some times I read articles to levelup my knowledge.

### How does Freedium work?
In short, we reverse-engineered Medium.com's GraphQL endpoints and created a custom parser and toolkits to render Medium posts. Sometimes we got a bugs because of the self-written parser, but we are working to make Freedium bug-free.

### What language are being used?
We use Python, with Jinja template builder.

### Wow! I would like to contribute to Freedium. How can I do that?
You can start from the https://github.com/Freedium-cfd/web repository.
